# _HW04: Tidy data and joins_

Hi! Welcome to my hw04 folder. You can view the html document of this assignment by clicking the following- [hw04](https://stat545-ubc-hw-2019-20.github.io/stat545-hw-racquellem/hw04/hw04_Mangahas.html). 

Here I used my data wrangling skills to solve problems on the gapminder dataset and on a wedding guestlist. I used several coding functions that allowed me to manipulate their data through aggregation and reshaping. 

Enjoy~

P.S. Thanks for all the feedback/comments!
