# _HW03 HTML File_

Hi! Welcome to my hw03 folder. As per requested, you can view the html document of this assignment by clicking the following- [hw03](https://stat545-ubc-hw-2019-20.github.io/stat545-hw-racquellem/hw03_Mangahas.html). 

Here I manipulated and explored the gapminder dataset with the dplyr package, and also created some interesting ggplots that showcased my findings. The three tasks that I chose to do were:
1. How is life expectancy changing over time on different continents?
2. Get the maximum and minimum of GDP per capita for all continents.
3. Look at the spread of GDP per capita within the continents.

Cheers,
