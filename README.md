# _What is this repository?_

Hi! Welcome to my repository (=repo). I'm guessing you have either just wandered onto this page or you're in fact the *peer* that will assess my work. Anywho, here you will be able to find files that I've created, worked on and saved for assignment completion. You can see all the __commits__, i.e. changes made over time, that I've made in this repo and also the coding behind all of it, for a better understanding of how I was able to do what I did.

# _Who am I?_

My full name is *Racquelle Sabrina Mangahas*. I'm a Filipino-Canadian MSc graduate student who recently (*literally around 4.5 months ago*)just arrived here from Oakville, Ontario. My field is in Oceanography :ocean:, where I will be studying the effects of Asian-derived aerosols on phytoplankton physiology and the water column in the Subarctic Northeastern Pacific Ocean. This requires me to board a Canadian government vessel and go on a 2-3 week long research cruise __three times a year__. I actually went on my first research cruise last month (August), and it was really awesome *(but to be honest, it was a love-hate relationship)*. 

Some foods that I enjoy eating:
1. :watermelon:
2. :fries:
3. :cake:
4. :cookie:
5. :grapes:
6. :tangerine:

and many more...
